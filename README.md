# Efficient-GPNN
An efficient implementation of GPNN depicted in "Drop the GAN: In Defense of Patches Nearest Neighbors as Single Image Generative Models"

This is the version of GPNN I used to compare with my model in the reaserach done for writing the paper "Generating natural images with direct patch distributions matching [CVPR 2022]"

This implementaion is inspired uses parts of the code from the implementaion in https://github.com/iyttor/GPNN.git
